# Security

## Supported Versions

We, as the yaws maintainers, strive to support all previous versions of yaws unless declared End-of-Life.

Typically -1 major SemVer versions are to be supported at very least when stable.

Unstable versions prior to the stable major 1 are to be supported through -2 minor releases.

## Reporting

Please contribute security related issues by e-mail to security@TBD prior to any disclosure.

We ask that contributors give us maintainers a reasonable time to address any issues.

Maintainers will work collaboratively with any contributor/s in order to verify and fix any encountered issues.

Contributors are not required to write a PoC or a fix.

Nonetheless initially private contribution would be most welcome and helpful prior to disclosure if so.

## Disclosure

We will publish and credit contributors relating to all the security issues through RustSec which feeds into various security databases independently.
